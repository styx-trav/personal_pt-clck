here's the project in so many words: a point and click.

first the scene situation, with a navigation system through interconnected nodes (s_node structures)
then displaying them through descriptions, and checking all memory leaks issues
then actually traveling it in the terminal
adding go_backs
adding a user_structure and action_objects in the s_nodes to be able to "unlock" added features of a scene or choices (maybe a char*tab* ? to be able to find more easily, using a placement int within the scene structure) => int tab, actually, because numbers are easier to allocate and also to keep track of !
makefile added for easier compilation

all done !

then expanding it into a fleshed out story_map, can't wait =)

alright, everything above works as needed:
we can now use objects within the inventory to unlock new possibilities, flow moves freely past the obstacle once removed the one time (okayed using a -1 instead of a zero for unlocked vs never locked in the first place)



will come back to this to expand on the world building we want to see

i maybe want this to be prophecy related, just exploration or character interaction included ? we'll see

go back glitches fsr -no ??? ig
also give a rulebook of some kind so people know what to do: "help" command
