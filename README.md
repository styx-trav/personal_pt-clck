this is meant to be a build-your-own terminal dungeon game maker
(despite the misleading name)

currently achieved:
- connected rooms or scenes;
- grabbable objects + inventory;
- characters and creatures within rooms;
- char/cre interactions:
        - dialogue;
        - fight;
        - death;
- user death/damage;
- user stat mods (+att or +def);

coming soon:
- a full game(hopefully);
